hide-sticky-promote
===================

*Update: I'm moving this to the drupal.org site as a sandbox project: http://www.drupal.org/sandbox/studiozut/2303677*

Drupal 7 module: hides the "promote to front page" and "sticky" checkboxes when creating/editing content

Now includes permissions to let selected roles still use "sticky" and "promote" options (thanks to Roger Codina and his contribution: https://github.com/rogercodina/hide-sticky-promote )
